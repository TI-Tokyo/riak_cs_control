# Packaging for Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux is a minimalistic, Gentoo-inspired, source-based distribution.

Packaging instructions for Alpine cannot be placed in
rel/pkg/alpine/Makefile without bending too many rules and
conventions.

Instead, the aim is to have the APKBUILDs for
riak\_cs\_control merged into the official "testing" repo.
